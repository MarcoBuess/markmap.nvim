INSTALLATION                                            *markmap-installation*

On lazy.nvim, markmap.nvim cam be installed like:
>
--  [markdown markmap]
--  https://github.com/Zeioth/markmap.nvim
{
  "Zeioth/markmap.nvim",
  build = "yarn global add markmap-cli",
  cmd = {"MarkmapOpen", "MarkmapSave", "MarkmapWatch", "MarkmapWatchStop"},
  opts = {
    html_output = "/tmp/markmap.html",
    hide_toolbar = false,
    grace_period = 3600000
  },
  config = function(_, opts) require("markmap").setup(opts) end
},

USAGE                                                          *markmap-usage*

The main way to use markmap.nvim are |Commands| (refer to that section).
One can create keybindings to use those commands.

OPTIONS                                                      *markmap-options*

                                                                 *html_output*
g:html_output
                        String that represents a path.
                        This is where the html markmap is generated.
                        It is also where the command |:MarkmapSave| will save
                        the markmap.

                        By default:
                        `Unix:    /tmp/markmap.html `
                        `Windows: C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp\markmap.html`


                                                                 *hide_toolbar*
g:hide_toolbar
                        Boolean value true or false.
                        When true, it will hide the +/-/maximize controls
                        from the markmap.

                        By default:
                        false

                                                                 *grace_period*
g:grace_period
                        Int number.
                        Number of milliseconds that will pass before
                        the markmap watch server is be killed.

                        Setting 0 as value will disable the grace period.

                        When doing this, the watch server can still be stopped
                        when leaving vim, or with the command |:MarkmapWatchStop|.

                        Note that this option only applies to the MarkmapWatch
                        server. Running |MarkmapOpen| does not create a watch
                        server.

                        By default:
                        3600000

COMMANDS                                                       *markmap-comamnds*
Note that all commands should be performed over .md markdown file.
They work on other file types, but results may vary.

                                                                 *:MarkmapOpen*
:MarkmapOpen
                        Renders and open a markmap from the current buffer,
                        A html will be generated on |html_output|.

                                                                 *:MarkmapSave*
:MarkmapSave            Renders a markmap from the current buffer
                        without actually opening the markmap.
                        A html will be generated on |html_output|.

                                                                 *:MarkmapWatch*
:MarkmapWatch
                        Renders and open a markmap from the current buffer.
                        A html will be generated on |html_output|.

                        Unlike |MarkmapOpen|, this command will update the
                        markmap in real time when changes are written to
                        the markdown file.

                                                                 *:MarkmapStop*
:MarkmapWatchStop
                        Manually stops the watch server after running
                        |:MarkmapWatch|. Note that this is not actually
                        necessary if you are using |grace_period|, which comes
                        enables by default.

                        Also, the mapkmap watch server will be automatically
                        killed if vim is closed.


FAQ                                                            *markmap-faq*
Run healthcheck markmap. This command will tell you the depencencies you are
missing. If the command do not exist, it means you are using an async package
manager, so double check the package is beign loaded. These are the most common
issues you will find:

    Run

yarn global add markmap-cli

    Now try to run

markmap

If the executable is not found, that means you need to add yarn to your `PATH`.
This is normally done in your .profile, bashrc, or zshrc file like this:

>
# PATH Example
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:\
$HOME/.cargo/bin:\
$HOME/.npm-global/bin:\
$HOME/.yarn/bin:\
$HOME/.config/yarn/global/node_modules/.bin:\
$HOME/.local/share/gem/ruby/3.0.0/bin:\
$HOME/.cargo/env\
/root/.local/share/gem/ruby/3.0.0/bin:\
/usr/local/bin:\
/usr/share/nvm/init-nvm.sh \
$PATH"
<

If you prefer using npm over yarn, you can, but double check that you have
the user space correctly configured as in some systems this is not enabled
by default (see here).

If you are on windows, the process is the same. But the place to set PATH
may change from one windows version to another.
